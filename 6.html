It was a moment of utter genius.</p> <p> Messi had started and completed the previous 37 matches for Bar√ßa, but looked far from jaded at Camp Nou on Saturday. 12 minutes after his sublime dummy he made it 3-1, perfectly placing his penalty kick into the top corner of the net.</p> <p> Then, in the 82nd minute, Messi added a second, his first from open play so far this season ‚Äì like the penalty, he turned smartly in the area before pausing and then unleashing a driven effort quicker than the speed of sound past Bravo.</p> <p> Bar√ßa won the game 5-2, but the key takeaway was once again Messi‚Äôs brilliance. Jaime Rinc√≥n, writing in Marca , quipped that Messi is the best without running or even touching the ball ‚Äì a nod to the controversy over the viral clip against Dynamo Kyiv .</p> <p> Featured image courtesy of AS. </p> Posted by <b> Alan Feehely </b> <br> 8 November 2020, 13:46 <span> Tags</span> Barcelona LaLiga Lionel Messi Related Articles Barcelona teenager in line to make United States debut 12 November 2020, 12:18 Barcelona transfer target talks up interest in move 12 November 2020, 11:50 Ex-England star: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never wanted to kick someone as hard as Marcelo&#8221; 12 November 2020, 11:28 <h3> Leave a Reply Cancel reply </h3> <p> This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
