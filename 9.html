Check out the reaction below:</p> <p> Earlier this week, former Barca player and Argentine legend, Diego Maradona, admitted that Messi's situation at the Spanish club is going to 'end badly'.</p> <p> "I knew it was going to end badly and I thought Leo was going to leave," Maradona told the Argentinian newspaper Clarin (via Marca) . "It happened to me too.</p> <p> "Barcelona is not an easy club and he has been there for many years and was not treated as he deserves.</p> <p> "He gave them everything, he took them to the top and one day he wanted to leave to get a change of scenery and they said no."</p> Lionel Messi and key players must take pay cut or club could go bankrupt Who's scored the most goals after 10 Champions League games?
